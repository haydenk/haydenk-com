This very tiny repository has a singular purpose of
deploying the cloudformation stack for haydenk.com.

In the end all it does is redirect www.haydenk.com and haydenk.com to https://github.com/haydenk

It may be a bit much to redirect in this manner but I already had a Jekyll site deployed with this
stack and I like the control I have over redirecting requests with Lambda@EDGE.

Personal blog and details are available at my github page, https://github.com/haydenk now.
